# monopyx

A ST75256 monochrome display library written in MicroPython. First focus is on I2C protocol, others will be added later.

## Why?

There are currently no MicroPython packages that can interact with st75652 based displays. And I need one.

## What displays are supported?

I have no clue. I'm focusing on the display I own first, and will add confirmed working displays to a list once I have it working on my own display, a JLX ST75652 256x160 white backlight display.

## Contributing

Open a PR and I'll take a look. A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will be added soon.
